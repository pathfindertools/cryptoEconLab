      CryptoEconLab is a global hub for cryptoeconomic research, exploring big
      ideas in incentive, token and mechanism design.
    subhead: What We Do
    body: >
      R\&D cryptoeconomics lab operating at the unique intersection of
      blockchain technology, computer science, network science, statistics,
      economics, and systems engineering. The team specializes in incentive
      mechanism design for Layer 1 (L1) protocols, smart contracts,
      decentralized applications (Dapps) design, and token governance. Our work
      enables the creation of new financial markets and the development of novel
      digital asset products.


      **In an increasingly networked and open world, cryptoeconomics will play
      an ever larger role in coordinating human and machine activities in
      building a better future.**
