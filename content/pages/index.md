      CryptoEconLab is a global hub for cryptoeconomic research, exploring big
      ideas in incentive, token and mechanism design.
    subhead: What We Do
    body: >
      R\&D cryptoeconomics lab operating at the unique intersection of
      blockchain technology, computer science, network science, statistics,
      economics, and systems engineering. The team specializes in incentive
      mechanism design for Layer 1 (L1) protocols, smart contracts,
      decentralized applications (Dapps) design, and token governance. Our work
      enables the creation of new financial markets and the development of novel
      digital asset products.


      **In an increasingly networked and open world, cryptoeconomics will play
      an ever larger role in coordinating human and machine activities in
      building a better future.**

        text: >
          For teams building new projects (or doing major revamps on their
          current project), we can provide support and guidance in designing the
          underlying economic model and tokenomics.


          This involves defining the system and actors and designing the main
          economic mechanisms and policies. We can provide a proposal for the
          mechanisms that can be used (and their tradeoffs), build simulations,
          and tune parameters based on economic goals

        headline: Change Proposal Analysis
        subhead: ''
        text: >
          Technical changes to protocols lead to impacts on the economics of the
          system. In these cases, we can assess the potential impact of a
          specific change proposal and propose mitigation strategies.


          This involves understanding the change and the current economic model
          of the project, building simulations to quantify the impact on a set
          of economic metrics, and communicating the economic tradeoffs of the
          change.

        headline: Economic Audits
        subhead: ''
        text: >
          For teams with ongoing projects or newly launched projects, we can
          provide a critical analysis of the underlying economic model and
          tokenomics. Such analysis has two main benefits, namely, uncovering
          potential issues with the current design and increasing confidence in
          the project.


          This includes a description of the incentives of the system's main
          actors, an analysis of the reward mechanisms, and a simulation-based
          stress-test of the main metrics that characterize the system's
          economy.

          that may be hindering the performance of their network and also to
          better understand user behavior and trends.

          Analyzing the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.
          These assessments involve examining the project's value proposition to
          consumers, revenue generating opportunities, and defining success
          metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the long-term.


          Assessments also involve analyzing the competitive environment,
          identifying potential risks, and identifying opportunities for growth.
          Ultimately, these assessments are used to help determine whether the
          project is worth investing in or not.
